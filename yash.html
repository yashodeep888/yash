<h2 style="color:blue;"> I love my city... </h2>

<p>I love Delhi. I love the trees and the monuments, the streets and the bazaars, the sprawling malls and the metro. They all come together as a cohesive whole to make it an unforgettable experience. I also complain about Delhi very often. The polluted air, the crazy traffic, the broken footpaths and the often seen dirt. Most of these themes resonate across the large number of cities and towns in India.With Indian corporates looking at new ideas for CSR investments could someone come forward to invest in our cities too?
</p>
<p>
Every city has a X factor, which is a combination of many things. Brands could connect by taking forward the conversations around these elements. For example, In a rapidly changing India, people are looking at older structures as inheritance that needs to be preserved. Could we revitalize things that have been lost along the way? Can we design socially responsible programs for for new urbanism that gen x could relate to: Care about causes? Start new movements? Can we celebrate the city in its various manifestations?
</p>
<p>
Some guiding principles for a program like ‘I love my city‘ could be:
– Connect your brand values to the aspiration of a city
– Make a genuine difference
– Look at not just preservation but creation of a shared future with multiple initiatives
– Generate conversations and initiatives that create positive outcomes
</p>
<p>
Though one would have to keep in mind that a connection with the city cannot be ephemeral. Genuine Impact is a medium to long term venture which moves beyond branding and into the realm of utility. To connect with the ‘X’ factor of the city, many activities, conversations and events are needed that require multiple stakeholders and partners.
</p>
</p>Some initiatives that could be considered are outlined here:</p>

<p><strong>WATER</strong></p>
<p>
The concept of a ‘Pyou’ or safe cool drinking water provided by individuals and communities in earthenware used to be a very common sight across our cities. This concept seems to have disappeared. In a hot country like ours water is in constant demand.
</p>
<p><strong>Action – water dispensers for the hot summer months</strong></p>

<p>
One hour of rain can lead to storage of almost 20-30 litres of potable water that can be used for cooking and drinking. Also with the right kind of recharging processes ground water can be recharged. Ordinary citizens are asking questions and trying to implement solutions around water harvesting, recharging underground wells and methods to conserve water.
</p>
<strong><p>Action – an online water forum that answers questions and connects people to solutions and solution providers.</strong></p>


<strong><p>TREES</strong></p>

<p>Each Indian city was known for its trees, they fit in with the climate of the city, its ethos and added to its unique charm. Somewhere along the way, either trees were felled or new exotic varieties ill-suited to the city were brought in. Planting trees and taking care of them on a long term basis could provide multiple benefits of clean air, recharging the soil and making the city look good.<p>

<strong><p>Action</strong></p>
<strong><p>– Plant the right trees for a city through the RWA / Colony association</strong></p>
<strong><p>– Creation of an online Tree Champions Club</strong></p>
<strong><p>– Adopt a tree campaign by school students </strong></p>
